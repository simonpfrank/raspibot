# raspibot
A hobby development of simple robotics on a Raspberry Pi 5.
Aims:
* Pan and Tilt camera driven by face detection
* Face recognition - intitially using OpenCV
* Multi array microphone to detect direction of wake word and reduction of extraneous noises, when wake word used
* Voice to LLM and voice response
* Movement - adding a wheeled base
Future:
* Experiment with models on the Raspbery Pi AI camera
* Some level of autonomouse movement, using ultrasound and possibly LIDAR

## Hardware
### Start
* Raspberry Pi 5 8GB
* Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I2C interface (PCA9685)
* Adafruit mini Pan and Tilt kit with micro servos assembled
### Phase 2
* Raspbery Pi AI Camera or Pi Cammera 3
### Phase 3
* Multi mic array (to be chosen)
### Phase 3
* WaveShare Robot-Chassis-MP
* Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor Bonnet for Raspberry Pi

# Current Iteration: Iteration 2 - Abstracted Hardware Implementation (PRD Phase 1)

## Original Prompt
"We are about to start the project laid out in the prd. I would like to build this iteratively. I have no packages installed yet and the adafruit servo controller is not yet installed on the pi So we will be able to boot strap, install packages, build functionality and do unit tests. But we will not be able to do integration tests or run the code. For each phase we will need to create a tech spec in the doc/specs folder. What do you suggest we start with"

## TDD Workflow

For each module:
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Document**: Add docstrings and type annotations
5. **Validate**: Run full test suite and hardware tests

## Key Design Decisions

### Abstract-First Approach
- **Interface Design**: Define clear abstract interface for all servo controllers
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new hardware options in the future
- **Consistency**: All controllers follow the same interface contract
- **Testability**: Mock interface for unit testing
- **Configuration**: Runtime selection of controller type

### Hardware Flexibility
- **GPIO Option**: Direct GPIO control for simple setups
- **PCA9685 Option**: Hardware PWM for smoother control
- **Factory Pattern**: Clean creation of appropriate controller
- **Configuration**: Environment-based controller selection
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if hardware unavailable

### Servo Control Strategy
- **Angle Validation**: Strict 0-150 degree limits (configurable)
- **Channel Management**: Validate servo channels and prevent conflicts
- **PWM Configuration**: Proper 50Hz frequency for standard servos
- **Smooth Movement**: Gradual angle changes for natural movement
- **Power Management**: Safe startup and shutdown procedures

### Pan/Tilt Coordinate System
- **Cartesian Coordinates**: Use x,y coordinates for intuitive control
- **Angle Conversion**: Convert coordinates to pan/tilt angles
- **Boundary Checking**: Prevent movement beyond physical limits
- **Tracking Algorithms**: Smooth following of moving targets

## Testing Strategy

### Hardware Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Mock interface for fast development
- **Integration Tests**: Real hardware with safety measures
- **Performance Tests**: Measure response time and accuracy
- **Safety Tests**: Verify limits and emergency procedures

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% line coverage for new code
- 100% interface contract coverage
- All safety-critical code must have tests
- Both controller types must be fully tested

## Risks and Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Interface Complexity**: Keep interface simple and well-documented
2. **GPIO Limitations**: Software PWM may be less smooth than hardware
3. **Controller Selection**: Provide clear configuration and fallback options
4. **Performance Differences**: Document performance characteristics

### Mitigation Actions
- Start with simple interface design
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Create clear configuration documentation
- Monitor hardware performance and provide fallbacks

## Notes for Restart

If we need to restart this iteration:
1. Review this document and hardware setup
2. Check servo connections and GPIO/I2C configuration
3. Verify package installation for both controller types
4. Continue from last completed TDD cycle

## Next Iteration Planning

Iteration 2 deliverables will enable:
- **Iteration 3**: PRD Phase 2 - Camera integration and vision processing
- **Iteration 4**: PRD Phase 3 - Audio processing and voice recognition
- **Future Iterations**: PRD Phases 4-5 - Mobility and emotion display

The abstracted hardware foundation established here will support all future iterations and PRD phases with flexibility for different hardware configurations.

# Jupyter Notebook Guidelines for RaspiBot Tutorials

## Why Jupyter Notebooks for Tutorials?

### 1. **Interactive Learning**
- Readers can run code cells and see immediate results
- Experiment with parameters in real-time
- Debug and test code snippets directly

### 2. **Rich Output Display**
- Show images, plots, and visualizations inline
- Display servo positions, camera feeds, detection results
- Real-time graphs of sensor data or performance metrics

### 3. **Progressive Learning**
- Each cell builds on the previous one
- Easy to skip sections or run specific parts
- Natural flow from concept → code → result

### 4. **Hardware Integration**
- Perfect for showing servo calibration results
- Display camera feeds and face detection in real-time
- Show sensor readings and motor responses

### 5. **Reproducible Documentation**
- Code and explanations stay in sync
- Easy to update when hardware changes
- Version control friendly with clear diffs

## Notebook Template Structure

Each tutorial notebook should follow this consistent structure:

### 1. **Header Section**
```markdown
# Tutorial Title
**Difficulty**: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced  
**Estimated Time**: X minutes  
**Hardware Required**: [List specific components]  
**Prerequisites**: [Previous tutorials or knowledge]
```

### 2. **Theory Section**
- Explain the concepts and principles
- Include diagrams or references
- Set expectations for what will be learned

### 3. **Hardware Setup**
- Wiring diagrams and photos
- Component placement
- Safety considerations
- Testing connections

### 4. **Code Implementation**
- Working examples with explanations
- Progressive complexity
- Clear variable names and comments
- Error handling examples

### 5. **Testing & Validation**
- How to verify the implementation works
- Expected outputs and behaviors
- Performance benchmarks
- Troubleshooting steps

### 6. **Next Steps**
- What to build next
- Related tutorials
- Advanced modifications
- Further reading

## Content Guidelines

### Code Cells
- Keep cells focused on single concepts
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Show both working and error examples
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Markdown Cells
- Clear, concise explanations
- Use headers for organization
- Include relevant images/diagrams
- Link to external resources when helpful

### Output Display
- Show real hardware results when possible
- Include performance metrics
- Display visual feedback (plots, images)
- Document expected vs actual results

### Safety Considerations
- Always include safety warnings for hardware
- Explain power requirements
- Document emergency procedures
- Include troubleshooting for common issues

## Best Practices

### 1. **Progressive Complexity**
- Start with simple examples
- Build complexity gradually
- Provide intermediate checkpoints
- Allow for experimentation

### 2. **Hardware Focus**
- Include actual photos of your setup
- Show real measurements and results
- Document hardware-specific quirks
- Provide alternative approaches

### 3. **Reproducibility**
- Use version-controlled code
- Include exact dependency versions
- Document hardware configurations
- Provide calibration data

### 4. **Community Friendly**
- Clear explanations for beginners
- Include common pitfalls
- Provide multiple solutions
- Encourage experimentation

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages listed in each tutorial
- Hardware-specific libraries (RPi.GPIO, etc.)

### File Organization
- Keep notebooks in `docs/how_to/`
- Use consistent naming: `##_descriptive_name.ipynb`
- Include supporting files in subdirectories if needed

### Version Control
- Commit notebooks with outputs cleared
- Use `.gitignore` for temporary files
- Tag releases with tutorial versions

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update when hardware changes
- Verify code still works with new dependencies
- Add new troubleshooting tips
- Incorporate community feedback

### Quality Assurance
- Test each tutorial on fresh setup
- Verify all code cells execute successfully
- Check that explanations are clear
- Ensure safety information is current

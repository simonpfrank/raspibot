# Project Chat History

## Camera Module Refactoring Session
* Created CLAUDE.md with development commands and architecture overview
* Reviewed camera module and identified over-engineering issues (template inheritance, complex abstractions)
* Successfully removed 270+ lines of deprecated code from PiAICamera 
* Eliminated template inheritance across all camera classes
* Unified all cameras to use Picamera2 interface instead of mixed OpenCV/PiCamera2
* Reduced USB camera from 444 lines to 174 lines using simplified approach
* Created unified camera detection using Picamera2.global_camera_info()

## Critical Failure and Recovery
* Attempted rationalization of camera loop logic but violated core principles
* Rewrote working detect() method instead of preserving it
* User was disappointed - violated "working functionality is SACRED" rule
* Complete rollback to backup branch required
* Added strict refactoring rules to CLAUDE.md with backup protocols

## Key Technical Decisions
* Picamera2 as unified interface for all camera types (USB, Pi, AI)
* Composition over inheritance design principle
* No template/abstract classes - concrete implementations only
* Preserve working hardware integration patterns (while loops, metadata capture)
* Git backup branches mandatory before any refactoring

## Rules Established
* Always ask permission before changing working interfaces
* Never rewrite working core methods - extract around them
* Create backup branches before refactoring
* Working functionality is SACRED - preserve first, enhance second
* Track all changes in docs/non_focus_changelog.md

## Pi AI Camera Cleanup Session - Instruction Following Issues
* Task: Remove unused functions from pi_ai_camera.py
* Issue: Claude attempted to modify working code and remove functions with internal dependencies
* Problem: Didn't properly analyze call graph before proposing removals
* Root cause: Overstepped "unused functions" instruction by trying to "improve" working code
* Resolution: Restructured CLAUDE.md for better instruction following with XML tags and explicit constraints
* New rule added: "Follow explicit instructions literally" - unused means zero calls anywhere
* CLAUDE.md reduced from 249 lines to ~100 lines with clearer structure

## Camera Unification Project - DRY Principle Implementation
* Removed unused is_similar() function from pi_ai_camera.py (28 lines eliminated)
* Refactored USB camera to follow pi_ai_camera patterns with consistent initialization
* Created pi_camera_new.py following unified approach with Picamera2.global_camera_info()
* Simplified camera detection logic - eliminated double loops with single-pass detection
* Added callback parameter to detect() method for extensible processing (face detection, annotation)
* Created comprehensive camera refactor design document in docs/camera_refactor.md
* Implemented unified Camera class in camera.py - single file handling Pi AI, Pi, and USB cameras
* Auto-detection prioritizes: Pi AI > Pi > USB cameras for hobbyist simplicity
* Consolidated all display_modes, config loading, start/stop/shutdown logic into one class
* Reduced camera module from 3+ files with duplicate code to single unified implementation
* All AI detection methods conditionally activated only for Pi AI cameras
* Fixed tracking logic with clear, self-explanatory code for maintainability

## Servo Module Simplification Project
* Analysis revealed servo module violations of CLAUDE.md guidelines
* Template class pattern (ServoInterface) with abstract methods against "concrete > abstract" principle
* Heavy code duplication across PCA9685 and GPIO controllers (jitter handling, validation, smooth movement)
* Overly complex enum-based factory pattern with 113-line selector module
* Created comprehensive analysis document in docs/servos-refactor.md
* Built new simplified architecture preserving all working functionality:
  - servo.py: Unified controllers with shared utility functions (219 lines vs 440)
  - controller_selector.py: Simple string-based selection (48 lines vs 113)
* Added full asyncio support for smooth_move_to_angle() method
* Eliminated template class entirely - concrete implementations only
* Extracted shared utilities: validation, jitter handling, calibration offset logic
* Added demo section moving servos 0Â° â†’ 60Â° for PCA9685 testing
* 50%+ code reduction (566 â†’ 267 lines) while maintaining all features
* Preserved jitter workaround (90-100Â° exclusion) and calibration functionality

## Room Scanner System Development
* Analyzed experimental room_scanner_v3.py and identified over-engineering issues
* Problem: Custom SmoothServoController duplicated existing servo smooth_move functionality
* Issue: 65 lines of redundant movement code when servo.py already had speed-controlled smooth movement
* Rule violation: Failed to leverage existing framework before creating new code
* Built production room scan system following CLAUDE.md principles:
  - raspibot/vision/deduplication.py: ObjectDeduplicator with 3 proven methods (spatial similarity, box overlap, temporal smoothing)
  - raspibot/movement/scanner.py: ScanPattern for servo movement calculations
  - raspibot/core/room_scan.py: RoomScanner main orchestrator
* Architecture decisions: Simple dict-based detections (no dataclasses), both sync/async support
* Critical bug fix: camera.process() was blocking execution - moved to separate daemon thread
* Added debug output for servo movements to enable troubleshooting
* System now performs systematic room scanning with robust deduplication of detected objects
* Followed modular design: vision + movement + core coordination as specified

## README.md Update Session
* Updated README.md to reflect actual current functionality post-refactoring
* Removed outdated spec references and aspirational features
* Added comprehensive progress checklist with âœ… completed vs ðŸ“‹ planned features
* Current working features: servo control, camera system, room scanning, object detection/deduplication
* Clarified hardware requirements and installation instructions
* Updated project structure to match current codebase (removed vision files except deduplication.py)
* Added key features documentation for camera, servo, and scanning systems
* Emphasized that many spec documents are outdated - current reality is focused core functionality

## Comprehensive Unit Test Implementation Session
* Created comprehensive test plan document defining 96 unit tests across all modules for regression prevention
* Built complete test infrastructure with pytest fixtures for hardware mocking (GPIO, I2C, cameras)
* Implemented 141 passing unit tests covering all business logic with proper async support
* Test coverage achieved across all modules: utils (21), settings (13), servos (28), cameras (4), vision (26), movement (17), core (19), controller selection (8)
* Resolved complex servo controller mocking issues by simplifying to focus on testable business logic
* Camera tests intentionally limited due to hardware complexity - documented what cannot be practically unit tested
* All tests designed for continuous regression checking during future development
* Key technical decisions: AsyncMock for async functionality, jitter zone testing (90Â° â†’ 86Â°), configuration validation
* Hardware abstraction: Successfully mocked all dependencies without actual hardware requirements
* Established re-runnable test suite: `python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v` â†’ 141 tests pass
* Updated test plan with implementation notes and camera testing limitations

## OpenCV Face Detection with Multi-Model Support Implementation
* Built OpenCV-based face detection following Test Driven Development methodology per CLAUDE.md requirements
* Created 32 comprehensive unit tests first, then implemented functionality iteratively until all tests passed
* Enhanced original simple Haar cascade implementation to support custom models while maintaining backward compatibility
* Added ONNX model support (e.g., YuNet face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx) with automatic model type detection
* Key features: versatile input handling (full frames or bounding box regions), coordinate mapping to original frame space
* False positive handling: returns None when no faces found, indicating object movement or detection errors
* Multi-model API: FaceDetector() for default Haar cascade, FaceDetector(model_path="path/to/model.onnx") for ONNX models
* Maintained 173 total passing tests (32 face detection + 141 existing) with proper type safety and mypy compliance
* Architecture preserves existing functionality while adding powerful state-of-the-art model capabilities
* Face detection module ready for integration with person tracking and screen annotation systems

## Live Face Detection Camera Integration - Phase 1 Complete
* Integrated face detection into camera system for real-time operation with TDD methodology
* Added face_detection=True parameter to Camera constructor with backward compatibility (default False)
* Implemented dual-mode operation: AI cameras run face detection on person regions, non-AI cameras on full frame
* Added visual display with white bounding boxes and center points for detected faces (distinct from green object boxes)
* Created comprehensive unit tests (8 tests) covering initialization, processing, display, and error handling
* Key integration approach: uses existing MappedArray from annotate_screen() method - no additional frame capture overhead
* Fixed critical frame validation bug: _validate_frame() expected 3 channels but camera provided 4 channels (BGRA)
* Successfully tested live face detection - white face boxes now display correctly during camera operation
* Enhanced Camera constructor with configurable face detection model path and confidence threshold parameters
* All 181 tests passing (173 existing + 8 new face detection integration tests) - zero regressions
* Live face detection operational and ready for room scanning integration in Phase 2

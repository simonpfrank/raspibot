# Project Chat History

## Camera Module Refactoring Session
* Created CLAUDE.md with development commands and architecture overview
* Reviewed camera module and identified over-engineering issues (template inheritance, complex abstractions)
* Successfully removed 270+ lines of deprecated code from PiAICamera 
* Eliminated template inheritance across all camera classes
* Unified all cameras to use Picamera2 interface instead of mixed OpenCV/PiCamera2
* Reduced USB camera from 444 lines to 174 lines using simplified approach
* Created unified camera detection using Picamera2.global_camera_info()

## Critical Failure and Recovery
* Attempted rationalization of camera loop logic but violated core principles
* Rewrote working detect() method instead of preserving it
* User was disappointed - violated "working functionality is SACRED" rule
* Complete rollback to backup branch required
* Added strict refactoring rules to CLAUDE.md with backup protocols

## Key Technical Decisions
* Picamera2 as unified interface for all camera types (USB, Pi, AI)
* Composition over inheritance design principle
* No template/abstract classes - concrete implementations only
* Preserve working hardware integration patterns (while loops, metadata capture)
* Git backup branches mandatory before any refactoring

## Rules Established
* Always ask permission before changing working interfaces
* Never rewrite working core methods - extract around them
* Create backup branches before refactoring
* Working functionality is SACRED - preserve first, enhance second
* Track all changes in docs/non_focus_changelog.md

## Pi AI Camera Cleanup Session - Instruction Following Issues
* Task: Remove unused functions from pi_ai_camera.py
* Issue: Claude attempted to modify working code and remove functions with internal dependencies
* Problem: Didn't properly analyze call graph before proposing removals
* Root cause: Overstepped "unused functions" instruction by trying to "improve" working code
* Resolution: Restructured CLAUDE.md for better instruction following with XML tags and explicit constraints
* New rule added: "Follow explicit instructions literally" - unused means zero calls anywhere
* CLAUDE.md reduced from 249 lines to ~100 lines with clearer structure
